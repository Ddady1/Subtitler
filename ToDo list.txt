Minor issues:
----------------

* When uploading the default settings it takes the '&H' in the color fields and then adds it again. Needs to trim it.
* Needs to do validation on the fields.
* Needs to fix that when user type only some fields the rest will come from defaults.json file if exists or the original default.
* Needs to finish the linked labels for information per field. - Done 16/11/23
* When hover with mouse over label the cursor should change to hand. - Done 16/11/23
* Work on a more sufficient help file.
* Re-arrange the help menu and finish it.



Development:
----------------

* Add the option to convert .srt to .ass
